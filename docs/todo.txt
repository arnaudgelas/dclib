make conditioning_class_kernel_3 have a pointer into its array that tells it how many 
elements are used.   this way it doesn't need to zero everything on construction.

































































a command line "percent complete bar".   something that uses \r and looks like
|==========                       | 25%
or something like that.   that would be nice.   




































some object that abstracts configuration managment.  like windows has the registry and
linux and posix stuff has basically nothing except for /etc and ~/.yourprogram sort of crap.
I should make an object that lets you "save" information to disk and then get it later.  but
you shouldn't need to know if you are using windows or a posix OS or any of that crap



















































the parsing end event in the xml parser should tell you the line number that parsing eneded on

































































an object which can fill an array of unsigned longs with primes







look for places to remove the use of references to arguments. use a 
temporary where appropriate































make an implementation of sequence that is just an array with slack on each end










something that mesures cpu clock ticks




















something that helps you make pdf files.  Just read the PDF standard and think
up cool stuff. :)







english word set with perfect hashing


something that helps you find perfect hash functions for a given data set









make something like the linker object but that has some events that tell you
when data is being sent so you can see what each side is sending. 






modify sequence_kernel_1 so that when you access the same element more than once at a time
it takes O(1) time












make some bayesian text categorizer














implement the hash table described on comp.programming.  the one
that uses an "infinite" array of buckets of sizes that are powers 
of two with the watermark.
also change the specs for hash table to say that the num_of_buckets is
an initial suggestion as to the size of the hash table.  not an absolute 
rule for the implementation.  say that it is a guaranteed lower bound or something












an object that makes it easy to save data to the end of an executable file.










email objects


new sockets stuff, UDP sockets, non-blocking sockets, IO multiplexing, negal alg on/off






make a priority queue


an echo object for networking shit.   holds connections and echos any data from one connection
to all the others

a broadcast object.   holds connections and allows you to send data to all of them easily






file sender function













an object which represents a file containing many text lines
like an array of strings which represents a file.






make an object that facilitates the creation of a gnutelli like broadcast network.
could be useful for making someting like a distributed server.  and that only requires a
few computers so its something actually doable without the support of 100,000 people

a few ideas about this.  when you connect to the first person on the network you then send
out a ping message and the pong messages you get back are from people who want more
connections,  the message tells you how many hops away they are and how many connections
they currently have.  you pick the one that is the farthest away and then to break any
ties you pick the one with the least number of connections.























an object which allows you to replace strings in a file with something else.  possibly event driven.
you give it a set of strings to look for and when it finds them you get an event and can write
whatever you want and then it continues on looking for more strings.






an object which will pick out all the links in an html file and any other convenient information from
the file.














make numerical stuff like, a big integer, big real, integration stuff, differentiation stuff,
matrix stuff, etc...













make a framework for creating web page interfaces to a program.  have stuff like buttons,
listboxes, dropdown boxes, checkboxes, etc...








































a kind of pop3 proxy that can perform mail filtering.  like picking out and taging spam
so that crappy email clients like netscape can put the spam into a folder

the filter could also buffer stuff it thought as spam for a while.  like hold it for a few hours and then let it be passed on.  this way all the spam comes wrapped together.  and so most of the time you get a flag saying you have mail it won't be spam.  only somtimes will it be the packet of spam.   




for the bigint object:
also consider adding a function which returns an unsigned short which contains the two least significant bytes from the bigint










an object which knows all about the different time zones and what not.  it could convert time from GMT to whatever local timezone you are in.  and any other useful conversions
